<p>I am a PhD student at Computer Intelligence Lab, KAIST, advised by Prof. Changick Kim. My current research interests are machine learning and computer vision, especially for <b> 3D geometry</b>, <b>multi-view stereo</b>, <b>scene flow</b>, <b>novel view synthesis</b>, <b>video depth estimation, and related 3D visions. I've deeply explored on <b>transfer learning</b> and <b>domain adaptation</b>. I've researched at KAKAO AI as a student researcher.
