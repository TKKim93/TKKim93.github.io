<p>I am a PhD student at Computer Intelligence Lab, KAIST, advised by Prof. Changick Kim.
My current research interests are machine learning and computer vision, especially for multi-view stereo, <b>scene flow</b>, <b>novel view synthesis</b>, <b>video depth estimation</b>, and related <b>3D visions</b>. I've deeply explored on <b>transfer learning</b> and domain adaptation. I've researched at KAKAO AI as a student researcher. </p>
